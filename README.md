# Healthcare Operations Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes healthcare operational data to identify trends in service usage, resolution times, and workflow efficiency. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills using SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI in a healthcare context.

The dataset used is mocked and anonymized to reflect real-world healthcare operations while maintaining privacy and compliance.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Python (pandas)
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel

---

## Business Questions
- Which service categories generate the highest volume of requests?
- What is the average resolution time by department?
- Are there trends or spikes in operational workload over time?
- Which areas may benefit from process improvement?

---

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
- Request ID  
- Service Category  
- Department  
- Date Opened  
- Date Closed  
- Resolution Time (Hours)  
- Request Status  

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
Data cleaning and transformation steps included:
- Removing duplicates and null values  
- Standardizing date formats  
- Calculating resolution time  
- Validating data consistency  
- Categorizing service types for analysis  

Cleaning and preparation were performed using Python (pandas) and Excel.

---

## Analysis
SQL queries were used to:
- Aggregate request volumes by category and department  
- Calculate average resolution times  
- Identify high-impact service areas  

Python was used for exploratory analysis and data validation.

---

## Visualization
A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize:
- Request volume by service category  
- Average resolution time by department  
- Monthly trends in operational workload  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)

---

## Key Insights
- A small number of service categories accounted for a large portion of total requests  
- Certain departments showed consistently higher resolution times  
- Periodic spikes in workload suggested opportunities for improved resource planning  

---

## Business Impact
This analysis demonstrates how data-driven insights can:
- Improve operational efficiency  
- Identify workflow bottlenecks  
- Support staffing and process optimization decisions  
- Enhance visibility for leadership and stakeholders

## Notes
This project uses simulated data inspired by healthcare operations to showcase analytical methods and tools. No real patient or organizational data is included.
